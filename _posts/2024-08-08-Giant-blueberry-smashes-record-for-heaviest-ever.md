# [Giant blueberry smashes record for heaviest ever](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2403/240318-giant-blueberry.html)

A farmer in Australia has just entered the record books for growing the world's biggest ever blueberry. The giant berry weighed in at a mammoth 20.4 grams. This **obliterated** the previous record, which was 16.2 grams. The record-breaker had a width the size of that of a table tennis ball, a diameter of 39.31 millimetres, and a 12.35-centimetre **circumference**. The record-breaking berry was almost 10 times heavier than a regular blueberry. The fruit was grown by staff at the Costa Group in New South Wales, Australia. Senior horticulturalist Brad Hocking said he was **overjoyed** to have the record officially verified by Guinness World Records. He said: "It's a combination of good breeding and good growing."

Mr Hocking said his blueberry was from the Eterna variety, known for its crisp texture and long shelf life. He told reporters: "Eterna, as a variety, has a really great flavour and a consistently large fruit. When we picked this one, there were probably around 20 other berries of a similar size." He added: "While the fruit is large, there's absolutely no compromise on quality or flavour, as would be expected when developing a premium variety." At first, he was unsure whether he had broken the record. He said: "We had to **recalibrate** the scales to make sure we weren't getting mixed up." When asked what he would do with his prize berry, he suggested a smoothie might be the most fitting end for it.
