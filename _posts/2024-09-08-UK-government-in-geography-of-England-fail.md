# [UK government in geography of England fail](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2310/231009-uk-geography.html)

The UK government has issued a **report on** its rail network that contains mistakes and questionable promises. The 36-page prospectus is titled "Network North". It was issued **in the wake of** **Prime Minister** Rishi Sunak **scrapping** the major HS2 infrastructure project – a high-speed rail link connecting the northern city of **Manchester** to the south. The **front cover** of the publication seems to have relocated Manchester 70 km north-west. Network North also committed to upgrading a road called the A259. However, this road is on the south coast of England. Among other bloopers, the report vowed to extend a tram network to Manchester airport. The airport link actually opened in 2014.

Government critics were dumbfounded and dismayed at the scrapping of the HS2 rail link. The line was announced **with great fanfare** by the Conservative government in 2012. HS2 was a major component in efforts to "level up" the north. Abandoning the link is seen as Mr Sunak's latest U-turn on a policy initiative. Just a year ago, he was committed to the project. Many people say it shows the government's disregard for the north of England. They lament railway lines in the north being "**Victorian**" – over a century old. The High Speed Rail Group said: "Every other major European country has managed to build a high-speed rail network, recognizing it's a vital part of a modern society and economy."
