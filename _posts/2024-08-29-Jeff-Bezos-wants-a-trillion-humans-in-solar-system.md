# [Jeff Bezos wants a trillion humans in solar system](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2312/231225-a-trillion-humans.html)

Just when **demographers** are **ringing alarm bells** about overpopulation, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says we need to **populate** our solar system. Mr Bezos was asked for his thoughts on humanity living in outer space in a thousand years' time. He replied: "I would love to see, you know, a trillion humans living in the solar system. If we had a trillion humans, we would have at any given time 1,000 **Mozarts** and 1,000 **Einsteins**.…Space would be full of life and intelligence and energy." He added that he wants to help "build heavy infrastructure that will be used by the space entrepreneurs of future generations…so that **ingenuity** and imagination can really be unleashed".

Mr Bezos' thoughts are echoed by fellow multi-billionaire Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly known as Twitter). In 2021, he said of the human race: "We don't want to be one of those single-planet species; we want to be a multi-planet species." Earlier this year, Mr Musk warned that: "Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming…mark these words." Mr Bezos conceives of people living in giant space stations. He said most inhabitants of these would visit Earth for vacations. He envisions our planet returning to its pristine environment, as factories would be built in space. He said they would exploit resources on the moon or on asteroids instead of using up Earth's.
