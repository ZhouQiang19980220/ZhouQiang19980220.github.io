# [Ghanaian one-year-old world's youngest artist](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2405/240527-worlds-youngest-artist.html)

A toddler from **Ghana(加纳)** has officially been recognized as the world's youngest artist. **Guinness World Records(吉尼斯世界记录)** acknowledged Ace-Liam Nana Sam Ankrah when he was just one year and 152 days old. The little boy began painting at the age of six months, when his **precocious** talent became evident. His mother Chantelle, also an artist, said it was obvious her son had artistic talent from that young age. She explained how he started painting. Chantelle had been **commissioned** to create a work for Miss Universe 2023. While she was working, she gave Ace-Liam a canvas and some paint. She said he clearly had an **affinity** for colour as he crawled over the canvas. Chantelle named his first piece "The Crawl".

Ace-Liam is attracting attention across the art world. His work was exhibited at Ghana's Museum of Science in January. Nine of the 10 pieces on show at that exhibition sold. Art lovers have purchased a further six of his paintings this year. Even Ghana's first lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo commissioned work from the toddler. Chantelle said her son is creating a stir with his artistic **flair**. She said: "He has created a buzz and heightened the conversation about art appreciation." She said: "His abstract paintings are inspired by the world around him – colours, shapes, textures and his mood." Guinness said: "There is no doubt that Ace-Liam has an exciting career ahead of him, and we can't wait to see what comes next."
