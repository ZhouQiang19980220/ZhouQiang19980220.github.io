# [Fatigue and sleeplessness are on the rise](https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2311/231106-fighting-fatigue.html)

In today's increasingly hectic world, more and more of us are experiencing tiredness and fatigue. Experts say there is an increase in the condition chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This is a physical and mental disorder that makes us feel extremely tired. That tiredness does not go away even if we rest. Sleep specialist Sammy Margo said: "Our lifestyles are characterised by constant connectivity, high stress and inadequate sleep." Nutritionist Dr Rohini Patil said people with CFS suffer from a lack of energy that affects every aspect of their day. She said eating better can help, saying: "While there is no cure for CFS, a well-balanced diet can play a significant role in helping manage symptoms and boost energy levels."

Dr Ben Kelly, a specialist in preventative medicine at the UK's biggest healthcare charity, offered some advice about how to deal with fatigue and a lack of sleep. He advised people to try his three-step bedtime plan. Step one is to turn the lights off because light keeps our brain active. He said blue light from phones and laptops is "particularly harmful". The second step is a good room temperature of around 19ÂºC. He said: "A cool room helps to reduce body temperature, which helps initiate sleep." The final step is to reduce all noise. As for food, life coach Simon Alexander Ong recommends we eat bananas to help us get a better night's rest. He said bananas contain chemicals that encourage sleep.
