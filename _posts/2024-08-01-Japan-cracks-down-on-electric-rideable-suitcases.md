# Japan cracks down on electric rideable suitcases

The latest advance in suitcase technology is causing problems in Japan. Many suitcases are now rideable. Travellers can sit on them, and travel at a speed of up to 13 kph. The motorized luggage is becoming increasingly popular. However, it is becoming a nuisance in some parts of Japan. More and more people there are riding their suitcases around airports, train stations and Tokyo streets. The problem is that the mobile luggage is classed as a motorized vehicle under Japanese law. This means they can be ridden on roads only. The rider needs a **helmet**, a driver's license, and insurance. Laws require the suitcases to be registered, and have a rear-view mirror and indicator lights. Airports in Osaka and **Nagoya(名古屋)** have asked tourists to pull rather than ride the suitcases.

Electric luggage has been around since 2016. Back then, a company called Modobag produced them. The company's slogan was "the carry-on that carries you". In the past year, the rideable luggage has become popular with celebrities. K-pop stars Blackpink, singer Katie Perry, and media personality Paris Hilton have all posted online videos of themselves riding their suitcases. Companies are also trying to make rules for the new way of getting around. British Airways will only allow them on airplanes if the **lithium batteries(锂电池)** can be removed because the batteries are a fire risk. **Kyodo(共同社)** News spoke to transport expert Dr Takeru Shibayama. He said: "Unexpected new forms of transport will continue to emerge." He added that new laws will always be needed.
