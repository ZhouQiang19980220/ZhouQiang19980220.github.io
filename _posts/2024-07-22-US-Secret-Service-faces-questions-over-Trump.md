# US Secret Service faces questions over Trump

The **US Secret Service** is facing questions after the attempted **assassination** of former President Donald Trump on Saturday. A shooter managed to climb onto the roof of a building that was just 130 metres from where Mr Trump was speaking at a **rally**. People who attended the event told police they had seen a man with a **rifle** on top of the building. There were also police inside the building from which the gunman fired shots at Mr Trump. The director of the Secret Service said the shooting "was unacceptable". She said: "This is an event that never should have happened." She added: "The Secret Service is responsible for the protection of the former President. **The buck stops with me**."

The shooting is the first attempt on a President's or former President's life since the shooting of **Ronald Reagan** in 1981. Mr Trump was speaking to a large crowd of supporters at his campaign rally near Butler, **Pennsylvania**. The 20-year-old gunman fired eight shots. One bullet hit Mr Trump's ear. There was blood on his ear and face. Secret Service officers immediately surrounded Trump. Secret Service staff hurried the former President to a nearby safety vehicle. One man died and two people were **critically** injured in the shooting. The gunman was shot and killed by a **sniper**. Mr Trump later thanked God for "preventing the unthinkable". He was well enough to attend a Republican convention on Monday.
